            <h2>The Category Management is an analytic process to separate and classify all the products in a counter of supermarket.
When you go to the Walmart Store and you want a Ritz cracker, you go and stop in front to the saltine and snack crackers section. Then, you make a choice. In this section you gone see like 5 different brands.
They are more than 2 brands;</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Keebler</li>
        <li>Nabisco</li>
        <li>Another Brands</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>  This process is important to giving the proper space for all the products. In this category, snack & saltine crackers, the more space is for the more sales brands. At this time Iâ€™ll give you in an order of sales;
  </h3>
